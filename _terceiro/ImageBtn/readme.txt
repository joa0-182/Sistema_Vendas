-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Installation

To Install TMultiImage component, choose Install Component from the
Component menu, and select the file MultiImage.dcu.
The component will be installed in the Double-G palette.

2. About Delphi version...

TMultiImage was written in Delphi 4 and then rebuilt in Delphi 6.
I don't test it with Delphi 5 nor Delphi 7, but I expect that it works fine.
To compile it with Delphi 2 and 3, I think that it's only necessary to change
unit ImgList with unit Controls in the Interface section of the unit.
If you get some problems, please contact me and I try to fix your problems ASAP.
See MultiImage.htm for help and information about copyright.

3. Personal note

I hope this component will be useful for your software.
I hope also that your life will be the best possible, and that all
your dreams will become reality.
